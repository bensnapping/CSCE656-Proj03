- [] Scene Description
	- Look slike he wants us to read the scene in?
- [] Final Gather
- [] Reflectivity
- [] Specularity
- [] BXDF struct/function
- [] Caustics (final gathering through refractive materials)
- [] Environment sphere
- [] No more random stuff (make an interesting scene and keep the structs separate)
- [] Add textures to spheres




every step just look at the light source. Ignore intersections there.

implement a gather shape instead of random reflection directions
