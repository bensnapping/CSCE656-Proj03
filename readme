These are the website files for Benjamin Moder and Genna Marenco

You can run the website locally by running a Node
instance in a folder with all of these files, or
you can see the code in action on our class websites:
- http://people.tamu.edu/~benjaminmoder/viza656/pr02/index.html
- http://people.tamu.edu/~~gmarenco/viza656/pr02/index.html

`index.html` is the main website file that references
the `shader.frag` file.

`shader.frag` is the actual glsl shader code, and can be
run in shadertoy with minor modifications.

`style.css` has all the styling information for making the
website look the way it does.

# Description
A very basic 3D renderer for matte spheres. One of the spheres
follows the mouse position, the others are generated pseudo-randomly
